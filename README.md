# Lemon Adaptive Layout

**A project to practice responsive web design using pure HTML and CSS.**

In this project, I took a non-responsive template and created my own responsive version to practice media queries, flexible layouts, and adapting interfaces for different devices.

## What I did

- Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Used modern CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid)
- Preserved the visual style of the original template

**Original template:** [Figma Lemon](https://www.figma.com/design/3FTKVOAbtrMgJvBvZGPSP1/Lemon?node-id=0-1&p=f)

[Live Demo](https://vchazova.github.io/ed-lemon-landing/)

**Project goal:** Practice responsive design and improve HTML & CSS skills without frameworks.
